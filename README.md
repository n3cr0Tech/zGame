STORY: You are Nelson, the biggest nerd in the school. Usually, you can get by
just by hiding from the bullies. But today is Dodgeball day. So you have to 
do your best to survive!


RULES:
You are in PE and need to dodge all the balls or else they might break your glasses.

1. Press the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, arrow keys to move and dodge them.

2. You have 100 health, if it drops to 0 and you're OUT!! (also Nelson will need a new 

pair of glasses)

3. For every 5 balls you dodge, an additional ball will be thrown into the game.
